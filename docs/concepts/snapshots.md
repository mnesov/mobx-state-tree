Snapshots are the immutable serialization, in plain objects, of a tree at a specific point in time. Snapshots can be inspected through `getSnapshot(node, applyPostProcess)`. Snapshots don't contain any type information and are stripped from all actions etc, so they are perfectly suitable for transportation. Requesting a snapshot is cheap, as MST always maintains a snapshot of each node in the background, and uses structural sharing

```javascript
coffeeTodo.setTitle("Tea instead plz")

console.dir(getSnapshot(coffeeTodo))
// prints `{ title: "Tea instead plz" }`
```

Some interesting properties of snapshots:

* Snapshots are immutable
* Snapshots can be transported
* Snapshots can be used to update models or restore them to a particular state
* Snapshots are automatically converted to models when needed. So the two following statements are equivalent: `store.todos.push(Todo.create({ title: "test" }))` and `store.todos.push({ title: "test" })`.

Useful methods:

* `getSnapshot(model, applyPostProcess)`: returns a snapshot representing the current state of the model
* `onSnapshot(model, callback)`: creates a listener that fires whenever a new snapshot is available \(but only one per MobX transaction\).
* `applySnapshot(model, snapshot)`: updates the state of the model and all its descendants to the state represented by the snapshot
